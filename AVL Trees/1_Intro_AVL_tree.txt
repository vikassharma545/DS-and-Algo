AVL tree : Height Balanced Binary Search Tree

Balanced Factor = height of left subtree - height of right subtree


for every Node in tree :- 

if |Balanced Factor| = |hl - hr| <= 1 and hl-hr = {-1,0,1} ---> tree Balanced

if |Balanced Factor| = |hl - hr| > 1 ---> tree not Balanced  (Imbalanced)


We Balanced Tree by rotation :-

1. LL-rotation :- rotate from left to right like thread
2. RR-rotation :- rotate from right to left like thread
3. LR-rotation :- rotate right to left then after left to right
4. RL-rotation :- rotate left to right then after right to left
