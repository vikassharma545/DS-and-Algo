we cannot control the height of binary search tree it depend on the order of insertion of element

like if we inserting 40,20,30,60,10,70 --> generate tree of height 2

but for same element but different order 10,20,30,40,50,60,70 -> generate tree of height 6

so we need some method ??

the binary tree which self control its height tha called AVL tree
