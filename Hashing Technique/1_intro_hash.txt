    why hashing use ??

    for searching a element from a list in less time

ex:-

    linear search        ->  Time ->     O(n^2) 

    Binary search        ->  Time ->     O(nlogn)

    search using hashing ->  Time ->     O(n) 


Hash function is use to mapping key into hash table 
(i.e hash function give index where we store element in hash table)


ideal hash function           -->  h(x) = x
brawback of ideal hash fun()  -->  use large amount space


modulus hash function           -->  h(x) = x % 10
brawback of modulus hash fun()  -->  collision(i.e two element can give same index of hash table)

resolving collision :-

Open Hashing:-
chaining

Close Hashing:-
1.Linear Probing
2.Quadric Probing
3.Double Hashing


NOTES :- hash can be different for different data its programmer responsibility to anylyse
         data and create hash fun so minimum time take in searching
