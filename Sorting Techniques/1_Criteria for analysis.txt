Criteria for analysis which sorting is best ?

1. Number of Comparison

2. Number of Swaps

3. Adaptive // if it already sorted it shoud take less time

4. Extra Memory // Memory used for sorting

5. Stable  // if it has dublicates (it preserve the order of arrangement of dublicates after sorted)
    ex:-
                Name - A B C D E F G        order of dublicates - C,E
                Mark - 5 8 6 4 6 7 10   
                
                after sorted - 

                Name - D A C E F B G        order of dublicates - C,E
                Mark - 4 5 6 6 7 8 10
