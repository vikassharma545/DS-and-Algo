 Tree : Tree is collection of nodes and edeges

              Height                                          Levels
                0                    |A|                        1

Root --->           |A| is called root of Tree

Parent  -->         |B| is Parent of |E| and |F| , |L| is parent of |N| and |D|

Child -->           |E| and |F| is child of |B|,   |G| |H| |I| is Child of |D|

Siblings  -->       |G| |H| |I| is siblings of each other i.e child of same parent

Descendents  -->    all node below that node   Ex- for |B| ->  |E| |F| |J| |K| |M| is decendents

Ancestors -->       all node from that node to root node   Ex- for |M| -> |J| |F| |B| |A| is ancestors    

degree -->          no of attach node downward    Ex- |B| have 2 degree,   |D| has 3 degree

Leaf, external, terminal node  -->              Node having degree zero

non leaf, internal, non terminal node -->       Node having degree greater then zero

Levels  -->  start from 1 onword    i.e count nodes downward

Height  --> start from 0 onword     i.e count edges downward

Forest  --> collection of different trees
