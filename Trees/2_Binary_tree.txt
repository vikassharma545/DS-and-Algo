// Binary Tree : tree having degree 2 or less then 2
// childrens numbers 0 ,1 or 2 only


// Numbers of Binary Trees by given Node 'n'

  T(3) = 5
  T(4) = 14
  T(5) = ?

  Formula-->    T(n)   =   (2nCn) / (n+1)     known as Catalan number




// Max height of Binary tree by given node 'n'

    Max height = 2^n-1




//  Catalan number another Formula

              n
    T(n) =  sigma  T(i-1) * T(n-i)
             i=i




// number of binary tree with different labels

    T(n) = ( 2nCn / (n+1) ) *  n!
                /               \
            for shapes        for different label permutation



// Min and Max height of binary tree in given nodes

    Min height = (log base 2)(n+1) - 1

    Max height = n-1




// Min and max numbers of nodes in given height

    Min nodes = h+1

    max node = 2^h+1 - 1



// Degree relation

    number of node of degree (0) = number of node of degree (2)  + 1
