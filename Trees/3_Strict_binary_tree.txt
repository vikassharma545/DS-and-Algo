//strict binary tree also known as complete binary tree or proper binary tree

strinct binary tree either have zero child or 2 child 
but not have 1 child  --> important





// height vs nodes

if height is given

    Min nodes = 2h+1

    Max nodes = 2^(h+1) -1


if Nodes is given

    Min height = Ceiling[(log base 2)(n+1) - 1] or floor[(log base 2)(n)]  floor --> integer part

    max height = (n-1)/2






// Internal and external nodes

    external nodes(leaf node) = Internal nodes + 1    always true
